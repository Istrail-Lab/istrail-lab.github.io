                    an exact characterization for several of the most studied
                    Ising models. Our results settle at once, for several

                    next-nearest neighbour interactions vs. 2D, and (3) the

                Our results axe obtained by establishing a Kuratowski-like
                characterization theorem for the class of (infinite) crystal
                lattices called Bravais lattices, that can also be extended to
                general crystal structures. The "forbidden subgraph," called
                Kuratowskian, plays the central role, being contained in every
                non-planar crystal lattice. This universality phenomenon
                (existence independent of lattice structure), captured in the
                "equation": Translational Invariance + NonPlanarity =
                Universality of Subgraphs, provides a unified understanding of
                non-planarity as a root of computational intractability. The
                important structural property of the Kuratowskians is that they
                are "embedding-universal" for 3- regular graphs, in the sense
                that every such graph has a subdivision included in the
                Kuratowskian. Several NP-hardness results are obtained in this
                paper, by using different types of Kuratowskians, which in turn
                witness NP-hardness of various counting coefficients of the
                partition functions.

                The exceedingly complex mathematical methods that solved the
                planar cases of the Ising model, could be interpreted as an
                explanation of why no 3D solvable cases have been found. Richard
                Feynman in 1972 commented " The exact solution for three
                dimensions has not yet been found". Our results, for the Ising
                models that we consider in this paper, provide evidence of a
                paradigm-shift: the "has not yet been found" needs now be
                replaced with "it may be computationally intractable across
                lattices."

        <p class="pb-8">
            Lars Onsager, Brown University Professor of Chemistry from 1928-1933
            and winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1968. In 1944,
            Onsager obtained the phase transition and exact solution for the 2D
            planar Ising Model (Ising ferromagnetic 2D plane grid). His seminal
            exact mathematical proof of the 2D planar Ising model partition
            function formula is considered one of the most extraordinary
            mathematical tour de force proofs in statistical physics. Answering
            the call to “make [the proof] human”, a dream team of mathematicians
            and physicists, including Kac, Ward, Feynman, Hurst, Kasteleyn, and
            Temperley attempted until 1975 to generalize Onsager’s proof to
            three dimensions, but without success. Kac and Ward, with
            contributions from Feynman, obtained a combinatorial proof of the
            Onsager theorem. In 2000, Sorin published the paper "Statistical
            Mechanics, Three-Dimensionality and NP-completeness. I. Universality
            of Intractability for the Partition Function of the Ising Model
            Across Non-Planar Lattices" at the Symposium on the Theory of
            Computing (STOC). His paper showed, for several Ising spin glass
            models, that for every non-planar (and therefore every 3D) model,
            computing the partition function is NP-complete. The proofs were
            axiomatic: Non-planarity plus Translational Invariance implies
            NP-completeness.

                The dimer problem and the Ising problem were finally solved for
                planar lattice graphs only. It was found that a generalization
                to nonplanar lattice graphs, including all three-dimensional
                lattice graphs, is impossible unless the number of Pfaans
                involved is allowed to increase to intractably large numbers.

                    No physically interesting nonplanar lattice has been solved
                    completely as yet. The simplest such lattice is the plane
                    square lattice with interactions along the diagonals as well
                    as the sides of the squares, sometimes called the union jack
                    lattice. It is somewhat melancholy thought that nearly
                    twenty-four years of work has added relatively little to our
                    knowledge of analytical properties of the Onsager Ising
                    model itself, though we now have a great deal more
                    information deduced from series expansions.

                    With monotonous regularity, each method has reproduced
                    virtually the same results as those listed above and has
                    added virtually no new ones on the analytical side. This
                    information may be summarized as knowledge for planar
                    lattices but not for any interesting nonplanar lattice of
                    the partition function and correlations as a function of
                    temperature in zero magnetic field, together with the
                    spontaneous magnetization and various boundary and impurity
                    effects. It relates either the trace of vacuum to vacuum
                    expectation of a product of linear sums of operators known
                    as Cliord or Fermi operators to what is known mathematically

                    The three-dimensional case does exhibit a phase transition,
                    but exact calculation of its properties has proved
                    hopelessly difficult. The two-dimensional case for so-called
                    nearest-neighbor interactions was solved by Lars Onsager. In
                    Onsager's solution, a veritable tour de force of
                    mathematical ingenuity and inventiveness, he uncovered a
                    number of surprising features and started a series of
                    investigations which continue to this day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The solution was difficult to understand, and George
                    Uhlenbeck urged me to try to simplify it. <strong>"Make it human," was the way he put it</strong>. At the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton, I met
                    John C. Ward, and we succeeded in rederiving Onsager's
                    result. Our success was in large measure due to knowing the
                    answer; we were, in fact, guided by this knowledge. But our
                    solution turned out to be incomplete. It took several years
                    and the effort of several people before the gap in the
                    derivation was filled. Even Feynman got into the act. He
                    attended two lectures I gave at CalTech and came up with the
                    clearest and sharpest formulation of what was needed to fill
                    the gap. <strong>The only time I have ever seen Feynman taking notes was
                        during the two lectures. Usually, he is miles ahead of
                        the speaker, but following combinatorial arguments is
                        difficult for all mortals</strong>.

                    It has been rather puzzling that the two methods at present
                    known for finding exact solutions for the Ising problem,
                    namely the algebraic method of Onsager and the combinatorial
                    method employing Pfaans, have exactly the same range of
                    application, although they appear so different in approach.
                    Problems which yield to one method yield to the other,
                    whilst problems which are not tractable by one approach also
                    fail to be exactly solved by the other, although the reasons
                    for this failure appear to have completely different
                    mathematical origins.
                </p><p>
                    On the one hand, Ising problems which cannot be solved by
                    the Pfaan method are characterized by the appearance of
                    crossed bonds, which produce unwanted negative signs in the
                    combinatorial generating functions, and such crossed bonds
                    are usually manifestations of the topological structure of
                    the lattice being investigated, i.e., the three-dimensional
                    cubic lattice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, the Onsager approach breaks down because
                    the Lie algebra encountered in the process of solution
                    cannot be decomposed into sufficiently simple algebra. It is
                    usually stated that such more complicated algebras occur
                    only when the corresponding lattice has crossed bonds,
                    although an explicit proof of this fact does not appear to
                    be published. It is difficult to see why the two methods
                    have exactly the same limitations.
