            Protein structure comparison is a fundamental problem for structural
            genomics, with applications to drug design, fold prediction, protein
            clustering, and evolutionary studies. Despite its importance, there
            are very few rigorous methods and widely accepted similarity
            measures known for this problem. In this paper we describe the last
            few years of developments on the study of an emerging measure, the
            contact map overlap (CMO), for protein structure comparison. A
            contact map is a list of pairs of residues which lie in
            three-dimensional proximity in the protein's native fold. Although
            this measure is in principle computationally hard to optimize, we
            show how it can in fact be computed with great accuracy for related
            proteins by integer linear programming techniques. These methods
            have the advantage of providing certificates of near-optimality by
            means of upper bounds to the optimal alignment value. We also
            illustrate effective heuristics, such as local search and genetic
            algorithms. We were able to obtain for the first time optimal
            alignments for large similar proteins (about 1,000 residues and
            2,000 contacts) and used the CMO measure to cluster proteins in
            families. The clusters obtained were compared to SCOP classification
            in order to validate the measure. Extensive computational
            experiments showed that alignments which are off by at most 10% from
            the optimal value can be computed in a short time. Further
            experiments showed how this measure reacts to the choice of the
            threshold defining a contact and how to choose this threshold in a
            sensible way.

            title="The Sequence of the Human Genome"
            blurb="A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort."

            A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic
            portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome
            shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was
            generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads
            (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones
            made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a
            whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used,
            each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded
            genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to
            create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been
            sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and
            assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought
            the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the
            number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be
            obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies
            yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent
            mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic
            regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90% of the genome is in
            scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25% of the genome is
            in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome
            sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which
            there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional
            approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse
            matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense
            clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C
            sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence.
            Only 1.1% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24% is in
            introns, with 75% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications
            of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are
            abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary
            history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate
            expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with
            tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis
            and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus
            sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1
            million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of
            human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on
            average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of
            polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1% of all SNPs resulted in
            variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have
            functional consequences remains an open challenge.

            In recent years, an explosion in data has been profoundly changing
            the field of biology and creating the need for new areas of
            expertise, particularly in the handling of data. One vital area that
            has so far received insufficient attention is how to communicate the
            large quantities of diverse and complex information that is being
            generated. Celera has encountered a number of visualization problems
            in the course of developing tools for bioinformatics research,
            applying them to our data generation efforts, and making that data
            available to our customers. This paper presents several examples
            from Celera’s experience. In the area of genomics, challenging
            visualization problems have come up in assembling genomes, studying
            variations between individuals, and comparing different genomes to
            one another. The emerging area of proteomics has created new
            visualization challenges in interpreting protein expression data,
            studying protein regulatory networks, and examining protein
            structure. These examples illustrate how the field of bioinformatics
            is posing new challenges concerning the communication of data that
            are often very different from those that have heretofore dominated
            scientific computing. Addressing the level of detail, the degree of
            complexity, and the interdisciplinary barriers that characterize
            bioinformatic problems can be expected to be a sizable but rewarding
            task for the field of scientific visualization.

            title="Frequencies of amino acid strings in globular protein sequences indicate suppression of blocks of consecutive hydrophobic residues."
            blurb={`Patterns of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues play a major role

            strings of 20–22 amino acids each are associated with transmembrane
            helices and have been used to identify such sequences. Much less

            frequencies of different lengths of contiguous blocks of hydrophobic
            residues in a database of amino acid sequences of proteins of known
            structure. Sequences of three or more consecutive hydrophobic
            residues are found to be significantly less common in actual
            globular proteins than would be predicted if residues were selected
            independently. The result may reflect selection against long blocks
            of hydrophobic residues within globular proteins relative to what
            would be expected if residue hydrophobicities were independent of
            those of nearby residues in the sequence.
