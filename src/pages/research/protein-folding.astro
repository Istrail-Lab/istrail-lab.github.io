            Protein structure comparison is a very ** fundamental problem for structural
            genomics, with applications to drug design, fold prediction, protein
            clustering, and evolutionary studies. Despite its importance, there
            are very few rigorous methods and widely accepted similarity
            measures known for this problem. In this paper we describe the last
            few years of developments on the study of an emerging measure, the
            contact map overlap (CMO), for protein structure comparison. A
            contact map is a list of pairs of residues which lie in
            three-dimensional proximity in the protein's native fold. Although
            this measure is in principle computationally hard to optimize, we
            show how it can in fact be computed with great accuracy for related
            proteins by integer linear programming techniques. These methods
            have the advantage of providing certificates of near-optimality by
            means of upper bounds to the optimal alignment value. We also
            illustrate effective heuristics, such as local search and genetic
            algorithms. We were able to obtain for the first time optimal
            alignments for large similar proteins (about 1,000 residues and
            2,000 contacts) and used the CMO measure to cluster proteins in
            families. The clusters obtained were compared to SCOP classification
            in order to validate the measure. Extensive computational
            experiments showed that alignments which are off by at most 10% from
            the optimal value can be computed in a short time. Further
            experiments showed how this measure reacts to the choice of the
            threshold defining a contact and how to choose this threshold in a
            sensible way.

            title="The Sequence of the Human Genome"
            blurb="A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort."

            A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic
            portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome
            shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was
            generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads
            (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones
            made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a
            whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used,
            each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded
            genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to
            create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been
            sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and
            assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought
            the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the
            number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be
            obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies
            yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent
            mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic
            regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90% of the genome is in
            scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25% of the genome is
            in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome
            sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which
            there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional
            approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse
            matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense
            clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C
            sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence.
            Only 1.1% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24% is in
            introns, with 75% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications
            of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are
            abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary
            history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate
            expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with
            tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis
            and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus
            sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1
            million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of
            human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on
            average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of
            polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1% of all SNPs resulted in
            variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have
            functional consequences remains an open challenge.

            In recent years, an explosion in data has been profoundly changing
            the field of biology and creating the need for new areas of
            expertise, particularly in the handling of data. One vital area that
            has so far received insufficient attention is how to communicate the
            large quantities of diverse and complex information that is being
            generated. Celera has encountered a number of visualization problems
            in the course of developing tools for bioinformatics research,
            applying them to our data generation efforts, and making that data
            available to our customers. This paper presents several examples
            from Celera’s experience. In the area of genomics, challenging
            visualization problems have come up in assembling genomes, studying
            variations between individuals, and comparing different genomes to
            one another. The emerging area of proteomics has created new
            visualization challenges in interpreting protein expression data,
            studying protein regulatory networks, and examining protein
            structure. These examples illustrate how the field of bioinformatics
            is posing new challenges concerning the communication of data that
            are often very different from those that have heretofore dominated
            scientific computing. Addressing the level of detail, the degree of
            complexity, and the interdisciplinary barriers that characterize
            bioinformatic problems can be expected to be a sizable but rewarding
            task for the field of scientific visualization.

            frequencies of different lengths of contiguous blocks of hydrophobic
            residues in a database of amino acid sequences of proteins of known
            structure. Sequences of three or more consecutive hydrophobic
            residues are found to be significantly less common in actual
            globular proteins than would be predicted if residues were selected
            independently. The result may reflect selection against long blocks
            of hydrophobic residues within globular proteins relative to what
            would be expected if residue hydrophobicities were independent of
            those of nearby residues in the sequence.

                The most vitally characteristic fact about mathematics is, in my
                opinion, its quite peculiar relationship to the natural sciences
                ... In modern empirical sciences it has become more and more a
                major criterion of success whether they have become accessible
                to the mathematical method or to the near-mathematical methods
                of physics. Indeed, throughout the natural sciences an unbroken
                chain of successive pseudomorphoses, all of them pressing toward
                mathematics, and almost identified with the idea of scientific
                progress, has become more and more evident. Biology becomes
                increasingly pervaded by chemistry and physics, chemistry by
                experimental and theoretical physics, and physics by very
                mathematical forms of theoretical physics.
                <br />
                There is a quite peculiar duplicity in the nature of mathematics.
                One has to realize this duplicity, to accept it, and to assimilate
                it into one's thinking on the subject. This double face is the face
                of mathematics, and I do not believe that any simplified, unitarian
                view of the thing is possible without sacrificing the essence.

                The protein folding problem is three different problems: the
                folding code – the thermodynamic question of how a native
                structure results from the interatomic forces acting on an amino
                acid sequence; protein structure prediction – the computational
                problem of how to predict the native structure of a protein from
                its amino acid sequence; and the folding speed (Levinthal’s
                paradox) – the kinetic question of how a protein can fold so
                fast... Current knowledge of the folding codes is sufficient to
                guide the successful design of new proteins and new materials.
                Current computer algorithms are now predicting the native
                structures of small simple proteins remarkably accurately,
                contributing to drug discovery and proteomics. Even once
                intractable Levinthal puzzle now seems to have a very simple
                answer...

                We must emphasize a statement which I am sure you have heard
                before, but which must be repeated again and again. It is that
                the sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to
                interpret, they mainly make models. By a model, I mean a
                mathematical construct which, with the addition of certain
                verbal interpretations, describes the observed phenomena.
                Furthermore, it must satisfy certain aesthetic criteria, that
                is, in relation to how much it describes, it must be rather
                simple. Since one cannot tell exactly how 'simple' simple is...
                Simplicity is largely a matter of historical background, of
                previous conditioning, of antecedents, of customary procedures,
                and it is very much a function of what is explained by it.

                It seems remarkable that so simple a model based on
                time-averaged forces can account for the stability and folding
                of a molecule as complicated as a protein. Looking at known
                protein conformations closely, one is struck by the precise
                geometry of the interatomic contacts that stabilize the
                molecule: all possible interior hydrogen bonds are well formed,
                and many of the nonpolar side chains interlock to form a
                close-packed interior. ... [T]he forces responsible for this
                precise geometry... cause the chain to fold into the approximate
                shape rapidly and without having to pass through many local
                minima... Although calculating the energy of the all-atom
                molecule would be time-consuming, one would have the great
                advantage of starting close to the right conformation... The
                general concept of using a simple model... when the detailed
                forces are too complicated has many potential applications...
                Such a hierarchical approach might eventually lead to an
                understanding and simulation of very complicated biological
                assembly processes.

                The central question addressed in this review is this: Is there
                some clever algorithm, yet to be invented, that can find the
                global minimum of a protein’s potential-energy function reliably
                and reasonably quickly? Or is there something intrinsic to the
                problem that prevents such a solution from existing?... Is there
                an approximation algorithm for global potential-energy
                minimization?... To our knowledge, the possible existence of an
                approximation algorithm for protein structure prediction has not
                been addressed... Such an approximation algorithm might be of
                significant practical use in protein structure prediction,
                because exactness is not a central issue.

                It is the mark of an instructed mind to rest satisfied with the
                degree of precision which the nature of the subjects permits and
                not seek an exactness where only an approximation of the truth
                is possible.

                The exactness of mathematics is well illustrated by proofs of
                impossibility. When asserting that doubling the cube... is
                impossible, the statement does not merely refer to a temporary
                limitation of human ability to perform this feat. It goes far
                beyond this, for it proclaims that never, no matter what, will
                anybody ever be able to [double the cube]. No other science, or
                for that matter no other discipline of human endeavor, can even
                contemplate anything of such finality.

                For a quarter of a century now, NP-completeness has been
                computer science’s favorite paradigm, fad, punching bag,
                buzzword, alibi, and intellectual export... pervasive and
                contagious.

                The true elegance of this consequence of natural selection was
                dramatized by the ribonucleases work since the refolding of this
                molecule after full denaturation by reductive cleavage of its
                four disulfide bonds... required that only 1 of 10^5 possible
                pairings of eight sulfhyryl groups to form four disulfide
                linkages take place...to establish... the “thermodynamic
                hypothesis.” This hypothesis states that the three-dimensional
                structure of a native protein in its normal physiological milieu
                (solvent, pH, ionic strength, presence of other components such
                as metal ions or prosthetic groups, temperature, and other) is
                the one in which the Gibbs free energy of the whole system is
                lowest; that is, that the native conformation is determined by
                its totality of interatomic interactions and hence by the amino
                acid sequence, in a given environment.
