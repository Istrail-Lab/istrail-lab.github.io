                The growing availability of inexpensive high-throughput sequence
                data is enabling researchers to sequence tumor populations
                within a single individual at high coverage. But, cancer genome
                sequence evolution and mutational phenomena like driver
                mutations and gene fusions are difficult to investigate without
                first reconstructing tumor haplotype sequences. Haplotype
                assembly of single individual tumor populations is an
                exceedingly difficult task complicated by tumor haplotype
                heterogeneity, tumor or normal cell sequence contamination,
                polyploidy, and complex patterns of variation. While
                computational and experimental haplotype phasing of diploid
                genomes has seen much progress in recent years, haplotype
                assembly in cancer genomes remains uncharted territory.

                In this work, we describe HapCompass-Tumor a computational
                modeling and algorithmic framework for haplotype assembly of
                copy number variable cancer genomes containing haplotypes at
                different frequencies and complex variation. We extend our
                polyploid haplotype assembly model and present novel algorithms
                for (1) complex variations, including copy number changes, as
                varying numbers of disjoint paths in an associated graph, (2)
                variable haplotype frequencies and contamination, and (3)
                computation of tumor haplotypes using simple cycles of the
                compass graph which constrain the space of haplotype assembly
                solutions. The model and algorithm are implemented in the
                software package HapCompass-Tumor which is available for
                download from http://www.brown.edu/Research/Istrail_Lab/.

            title="Intellectual Disability Is Associated with Increased Runs of Homozygosity in Simplex Autism"
            blurb={`Intellectual disability (ID), often attributed to
            autosomal-recessive mutations, occurs in 40% of autism spectrum

            Intellectual disability (ID), often attributed to
            autosomal-recessive mutations, occurs in 40% of autism spectrum
            disorders (ASDs). For this reason, we conducted a genome-wide
            analysis of runs of homozygosity (ROH) in simplex ASD-affected
            families consisting of a proband diagnosed with ASD and at least one
            unaffected sibling. In these families, probands with an IQ â‰¤ 70 show
            more ROH than their unaffected siblings, whereas probands with an IQ
            > 70 do not show this excess. Although ASD is far more common in
            males than in females, the proportion of females increases with
            decreasing IQ. Our data do support an association between ROH burden
            and autism diagnosis in girls; however, we are not able to show that
            this effect is independent of low IQ. We have also discovered
            several autism candidate genes on the basis of finding (1) a single
            gene that is within an ROH interval and that is recurrent in autism
            or (2) a gene that is within an autism ROH block and that harbors a
            homozygous, rare deleterious variant upon analysis of
            exome-sequencing data. In summary, our data suggest a distinct
            genetic architecture for participants with autism and co-occurring
            intellectual disability and that this architecture could involve a
            role for recessively inherited loci for this autism subgroup.

                The de novo assembly of transcriptomes from short shotgun
                sequencesraises challenges due to random and non-random
                sequencing biases andinherent transcript complexity. We sought
                to define a pipeline for denovo transcriptome assembly to aid
                researchers working withemerging model systems where well
                annotated genome assemblies are notavailable as a reference. To
                detail this experimental and computationalmethod, we used early
                embryos of the sea anemone, Nematostellavectensis, an emerging
                model system for studies of animal body planevolution. We
                performed RNA-seq on embryos up to 24 h of developmentusing
                Illumina HiSeq technology and evaluated independent de
                novoassembly methods. The resulting reads were assembled using
                either theTrinity assembler on all quality controlled reads or
                both the Velvet andOases assemblers on reads passing a stringent
                digital normalization filter.A control set of mRNA standards
                from the National Institute of Standards andTechnology (NIST)
                was included in our experimental pipeline to invest
                ourtranscriptome with quantitative information on absolute
                transcript levelsand to provide additional quality control.
            </p>
            <p>
                We generated >200 million paired-end reads from directional cDNA
                librariesrepresenting well over 20 Gb of sequence. The Trinity
                assembler pipeline,including preliminary quality control steps,
                resulted in more than 86% ofreads aligning with the reference
                transcriptome thus generated.Nevertheless, digital normalization
                combined with assembly by Velvet andOases required far less
                computing power and decreased processing time whilestill mapping
                82% of reads. We have made the raw sequencing reads andassembled
                transcriptome publically available.

                Nematostella vectensis was chosen for its strategic position in
                thetree of life for studies into the origins of the animal body
                plan, however, the challenge of reference-free transcriptome
                assembly is relevant to allsystems for which well annotated gene
                models and independently verifiedgenome assembly may not be
                available. To navigate this new territory, wehave constructed a
                pipeline for library preparation and computationalanalysis for
                de novo transcriptome assembly. The gene modelsdefined by this
                reference transcriptome define the set of genes transcribedin
                early Nematostella development and will provide a valuable
                dataset for further gene regulatory network investigations.

                Genome-wide haplotype reconstruction from sequence data, or
                haplotype assembly, is at the center of major challenges in
                molecular biology and life sciences. For complex eukaryotic
                organisms like humans, the genome is vast and the population
                samples are growing so rapidly that algorithms processing
                high-throughput sequencing data must scale favorably in terms of
                both accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, current
                models and methodologies for haplotype assembly (i) do not
                consider individuals sharing haplotypes jointly, which reduces
                the size and accuracy of assembled haplotypes, and (ii) are
                unable to model genomes having more than two sets of homologous
                chromosomes (polyploidy). Polyploid organisms are increasingly
                becoming the target of many research groups interested in the
                genomics of disease, phylogenetics, botany and evolution but
                there is an absence of theory and methods for polyploid
                haplotype reconstruction.

                In this work, we present a number of results, extensions and
                generalizations of compass graphs and our HapCompass framework.
                We prove the theoretical complexity of two haplotype assembly
                optimizations, thereby motivating the use of heuristics.
                Furthermore, we present graph theoryâ€“based algorithms for the
                problem of haplotype assembly using our previously developed
                HapCompass framework for (i) novel implementations of haplotype
                assembly optimizations (minimum error correction), (ii) assembly
                of a pair of individuals sharing a haplotype tract identical by
                descent and (iii) assembly of polyploid genomes. We evaluate our
                methods on 1000 Genomes Project, Pacific Biosciences and
                simulated sequence data.
