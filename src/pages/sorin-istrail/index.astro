        Sorin Istrail is the James A. and Julie N. Brown Professor of
        Computational and Mathematical Sciences and Professor of Computer
        Science, and former Director of the Center for Computational Molecular
        Biology at Brown University. He is Professor Honoris Causa of the
        Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, Iasi, Romania.
    </p>
    <p class="p-2">
        Before joining Brown, he was the Senior Director and Head of Informatics
        Research at Celera Genomics, where his group played a central role in
        the construction of the sequence of the human genome; they co-authored <a

            href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1058040"
            >"The Sequence of the Human Genome"</a
        > (Science, 2001) which, with over 20,000 citations to date, is one of the
        most cited scientific paper. His group at Celera Genomics also built a powerful
        suite of genome-assembly-to-genome-assembly alignment algorithms that was
        used for the comparison of all human genome assemblies to date in the paper
        <a
            class="underline hover:text-blue-400"
            href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0307971100"
            >"Whole Genome Shotgun Assembly and Comparison of Human Genome
            Assemblies"</a
        > (PNAS 2004). In 2002, his Celera group in collaboration with the company
        ClearForrest won the ACM KDD Cup - the top international data mining/machine
        learning competition. The challenge then was the automatic annotation of
        a section of the Drosophila genome.
    </p>
    <p class="p-2">
        In 2003, he joined the ranks of Applied Biosystems Science Fellows, one
        of just six science fellows in a company of 800 scientists. Before
        Celera, Professor Istrail founded and led the Computational Biology
        Project at Sandia National Laboratories (1992-2000). In 2000, he
        obtained the negative solution (computational intractability) of a 50
        years old unresolved problem in statistical mechanics, the
        <a

            >Three-Dimensional Ising Model Problem</a
        > (STOC 2000). This work was included in the Top 100 Most Important Discoveries
        of the U.S. Department of Energy's first 25 years, and as the 7th top achievement
        of DOE in Advanced Scientific Computing.
    </p>
    <p class="p-2">
        Professor Istrail's current research focuses on SNPs and haplotypes and
        genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the regulatory genome and gene
        regulatory networks, and protein folding algorithms; algorithms and
        computational complexity; and statistical physics.
    </p>
    <p class="p-2">
        He is the former Co-Editor-In-Chief of the Journal of Computational
        Biology (2000 - 2020) and together with Pavel Pevnzer and Mike Waterman,
        he is the co-founded the RECOMB Conference Series (Annual International
        Conference on Computational Molecular Biology) in 1997. He is the
        co-editor of the MIT Press Computational Molecular Biology series, and
        co-editor of the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Bioinfromatics series.
